Learning to use GitHub using the Hello World tutorial https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

# About Me
I am a **Maths graduate** with over ten years teaching experience but I want to set my mind to something new. I am learning to code using [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).  Having completed the first *four* certications, I want to test out my skills by trying to build an app of my own. First, I need to learn how to make the most of **GitHub**.
